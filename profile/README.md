# Sackosoft

Welcome, engineer, to the forge of robust software craftsmanship.

## Our Purpose

We craft the magical platorms that enable developers to build powerful, reliable systems while
focusing purely on their domain logic. Our creations handle the arcane complexities of infrastructure,
persistence, and reliability; so you don't have to.

## The Ancient Arts

*"Software should be elegant in its simplicity, beautiful in its utility, and excellent in its execution."*

Sackosoft strives to follows the teachings of ancient sages and modern masters. The sorcery our code
seeks to promote magics that:

- Favor unsurprising incantations,
- Favor clear paths over clever tricks,
- Conjute explicit instead of implicit energies,
- Leverage static tying and compile time correctness over unstable dynamic spells,
- Built from composable and reusable pieces,
- And, above all else, sustainable excellence over temporary advantage.

Each creation seeks to manifests these principles through carefully considered APIs, thorough documentation,
and robust implementations forged in systems languages.
