# Sackosoft

We build the columns for your next project to stand on.

## Our Purpose

We hope to craft the magical platorms that enable developers to build powerful, reliable systems while
focusing purely on their problem domains. Our creations help handle the arcane complexities of infrastructure,
persistence, and reliability; so you don't have to.

## The Ancient Arts

*"Software should be elegant in its simplicity, beautiful in its utility, and excellent in its execution."*

Sackosoft strives to follow the wistom of ancient sages and modern masters alike. Our coded sorcery seeks
to promote the [Principles of Responsible Conjurations](#the-principles-of-responsible-conjurations-porc)

## The Principles of Responsible Conjurations (PORC)

- Favor unsurprising incantations over clever tricks.
- Conjure explicit instead of implicit energies.
- Leverage static and strongly typed spells where it *really matters* and benefit from unstable spells where it doesn't.
- Favor composable and reusable illusions.
- Magic is for the benefit of our kind and ought to be cast only for the enrichment of our world.
- Prioritize sustainable excellence over temporary advantage.

Each creation seeks to manifests these principles through carefully considered APIs, thorough documentation,
and robust implementations forged in systems languages.
